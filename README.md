# Fall2025Startup
## Project Name: ArtTart 
*Name subject to change*

[My Notes](notes.md)

## Elevator Pitch
This application ArtTart would be a place for artists to share their works in progress and send and recieve constructive critism from other artists. It will allow users to upload and interact with works at multiple stages of the process, focusing more on the creation and artistic process rather than just the final result. Users would be able to support critisms or comments or disupport them though a like-dislike system, called 'heArts' and 'fArts' respectively. This is similar to the popular website Reddit functionally, but the ability to have timeline based posts and emphasis on positive critiques will differentiate it.

## Technologies
*Please note I'm still learning this process, so some uses of these technologies may be innacurate and/or impossible*

**HTML** - Basic Structure of pages, such as login page, viewing page, or upload page

**CSS** - Create a neutral and non-destracting style that works with multiple devices

**React** - Use react to create expressive interactable features such as my cleverly named like-dislike system, and be able to send that information to the backend of the system

**Service** - Backend should be able to process...
* Login data
* Multiple Image Uploads
* Storing Comments
* Use a clock API to timestamp uploads

**DB/Login** - Used for storage of accounts, posts, and comments

**Websocket** - Displaying uploaded posts from other accounts.
