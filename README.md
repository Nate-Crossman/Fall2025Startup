## Project Name: ArtTart 
Name subject to change

[My Notes](notes.md)

## Elevator Pitch
This application ArtTart would be a place for artists to share their works in progress and send and recieve constructive critism from other artists. It will allow users to upload and interact with works at multiple stages of the process, focusing more on the creation and artistic process rather than just the final result. Users would be able to support critisms or comments or disupport them though a like-dislike system, called 'heArts' and 'fArts' respectively. This is similar to the popular website Reddit functionally, but the ability to have timeline based posts and emphasis on positive critiques will differentiate it.
